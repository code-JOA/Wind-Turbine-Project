# Background
In 2021 wind electricity generation increased by a record 273 TWh (up 17%). This was 55% higher growth than that achieved in 2020 and was the highest growth among all renewable power technologies. However, to get on track to meet the Net Zero target (for decarbonising) by 2050, which includes approximately 7 900 TWh of wind electricity generation in 2030, it will be necessary to continue to expand wind turbine capacity by approximately 18% annual growth between 2022 and 2030.
