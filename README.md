What a Wind Turbine Looks like :

# Background
In 2021 wind electricity generation increased by a record 273 TWh (up 17%). This was 55% higher growth than that achieved in 2020 and was the highest growth among all renewable power technologies. However, to get on track to meet the Net Zero target (for decarbonising) by 2050, which includes approximately 7 900 TWh of wind electricity generation in 2030, it will be necessary to continue to expand wind turbine capacity by approximately 18% annual growth between 2022 and 2030.

# Challenge

Due to these targets, we will see many new turbine farm deployments, a mix of both onshore and offshore. Not only is this a huge challenge from a manufacturing and construction standpoint but crucially also in effective maintenance – keeping the blades turning.  

Access to and maintenance of wind turbines is both difficult and expensive, especially when offshore. On average turbines can only be inspected once or twice a year, when mechanical and electrical assemblies are checked, minor repairs are performed and consumables like greases, oils and filters can be exchanged, but what happens in between these infrequent service intervals?  

Unlike most process critical rotating assets in manufacturing, such as gearboxes, it is not possible to take samples of oil monthly or quarterly to assess whether internal mechanical damage is starting to occur. The opportunity to predict a failure and intervene in time to prevent costly or even catastrophic damage with conventional maintenance practices is extremely limited.
